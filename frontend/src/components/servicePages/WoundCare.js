    <h1>Wound Care at Encompass HealthCare</h1>
    <p>Wound care is our specialty. At Encompass Healthcare and Wound Medicine in West Bloomfield Michigan, we specialize in healing non-healing wounds with our sophisticated, hospital-level wound care all in our outpatient office so that you don’t have to go to the hospital. Any wound that has not healed in 4 weeks is considered a non-healing wound.</p>
    <p>Our outpatient wound care and infection facility, located on the border of West Bloomfield, Walled Lake and Commerce township, is just minutes from Farmington, Farmington Hills, Troy, Brighton and many Oakland County Michigan cities.</p>

    <h2>At Encompass HealthCare & Wound Medicine, we have the most advanced outpatient wound care treatment in Metro Detroit.
    </h2>
    <p>Encompass HealthCare was created to offer patients access to hospital-level wound treatment modalities, infection treatment, cutting edge technologies and total services in a convenient and comfortable outpatient setting, without the risks associated with in-hospital treatments. That allows for better results, reduced costs and increased patient satisfaction.</p>
    <p>Rather than focus on the wound, we actually reverse the underlying conditions that interfere with wound healing. This is a markedly wound care different approach to treating non-healing wounds that patients experience before finding Encompass HealthCare & Wound Medicine. That’s why we say that “we heal from the inside out.” Our Medical Director Dr. Bruce Ruben takes all of the patient’s physical, mental and lifestyle factors into consideration before we create an individualized treatment plan.</p>
